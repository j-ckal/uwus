I'm transferring my website over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) so this list is from my original website, with a few added extras whenver I remember to update it.

## Productivity

- [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/) - Simple Pomodoro timer for breaking down tasks.
- [Countdowns (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/app/id917514700) - I like to put *nice* calendar events (holidays, gigs, etc) in here to remind me what I've got to look forward to.
- Boring Calendar/Reminders - Because I also need to remember when I've got meetings/no toothpaste left.
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) - Record PC video/audio, make custom layouts for recording/streaming.
- [SimpleMind](https://simplemind.eu/) - Nice flow-chart and mind mapping tool. Useful when trying to learn complex systems.

## Tools for Windows

- [ShutUp10++](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) - Easy application to remove some of the SaaS/clutter/advertisements from Windows 10/11. Stick to the recommended options if you don't want to break things.
- [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/powertoys/) - Microsoft developed customisation tool for Windows. Key rebinding and custom window snapping is cool.
- [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) - For the gamers, allows you to overlay system stats when playing games to find bottlenecks. Also allows you to overclock your GPU but I don't bother.
- [Revo Uninstaller](https://www.revouninstaller.com/) - Uninstall programs from here and it will scan for leftover files to save space and clutter.

## Tools for macOS

- [SteelSeries ExactMouse](https://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/SteelSeries-ExactMouse-Tool.shtml) - ⚠️ Scan with VirusTotal or similar before installing! This tool is now depreciated in favour of a much more bloated *SteelSeries Engine* application. This is an older menubar app that allows you to disable macOS's weird mouse acceleration curve.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - Enables edge-snapping of windows.
- [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - Similar to Revo on Windows, drag apps here to uninstall and it will scan for leftover files & folders.
- [EasyRes](http://easyresapp.com/) - Menubar app that lets you manually select different resolution/scaling options for your display(/s).
- [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) - Helps extend battery health by limiting % charge allowed when plugged in. I usually have mine set to 80%.
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) - Spin up VMs using QEMU or Apple's virtualisation framework.
