## Intro

Hello! I've not really figured out how to write in the style of a blog yet, so this probably comes across as somewhere between a Twitter thread and formal presentation. 

I've been tinkering with secondary computers since I got a Pi 3B for my birthday in 2016, but didn't really use it for what I imagined a server to be, outside of installing Pi-hole to do DNS-level ad blocking. I wasn't that interested in the GPIO capabilities outside of a [university project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1y6sschMHc), and wanted something more powerful to play with.

## Enter, the HP ProDesk!

I found this back in February, and aside from looking like it was pulled from a school computer lab, it checked all my boxes:

- Power efficient - Reasonably modern T-sku CPU (Full support for [ACPI C-states](https://metebalci.com/blog/a-minimum-complete-tutorial-of-cpu-power-management-c-states-and-p-states/)), uses <5W while idle!
- Hyperthreading for multithreaded workloads
- 8GB RAM + 256GB SSD included (No idea about the specs, but saved me money)
- £70, which was cheaper than anything else I could find at the time

The only issue was 1 broken USB port which I didn't mind, and a blemish I couldn't find.

For now, I'm using an old USB [LaCie drive](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HKVD2ZM/A/lacie-1tb-rugged-usb-c-portable-drive) I had lying around for media storage, formatted in exFAT so I can still read/write from macOS & Windows.

It arrived running Windows 10 with a registered project key (!) alas, I formatted it and installed Ubuntu Server 22.04, for no reason other than familiarity. I updated & upgraded, copied over my SSH keys, and did the other boring stuff.

## Containers
I had Home Assistant and Plex ~~running~~ crawling on my Raspberry Pi, and this was my first experience managing multiple services running on bare metal on one machine. 

As you can imagine, dealing with conflicting ports and dependencies was a headache - [*looking at you, Pi-hole*](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues/1785) - and since I was starting from fresh I wanted to learn more about running Docker properly.  *~In Production~* I guess.

I migrated existing services over to the new containerised versions, which was surprisingly painless. I used docker-compose to deploy them, with much help from the [linuxserver.io images & docs](https://linuxserver.io). 

I later learnt about [Portainer](https://portainer.io) which I now use to reduce the amount of time spent finding container logs & managing things from the terminal.

## External Access

For a while I exposed the *raw, unadulterated ports* of my self-hosted services to the internet, and watched fail2ban go to work on the deluge of bot attacks, predominately originating from China and DigitalOcean. This made me uneasy, and I wanted to add another layer of security to my home-lab.

I'm using a Cloudflare Tunnel to expose Home Assistant & SSH to the internet, protected behind SSO. It's crazy how many of Cloudflare's services are available on the free tier! This method mitigates some risks but introduces some new ones:

- No longer exposing any ports from my home network, preventing bots from bruteforcing/exploiting possible future vulnerabilities 👍
- An approved login method, verified through CloudFlare, is now required before any services can be reached 👍
- Since Cloudflare is proxying traffic going to/from my server, they now have the ability to inspect/analyse this 👎
- I now have a permanently running, self-updating binary running that has access to my system & local network (I could improve this with segmentation, but for now 👎)

I followed a few different [tutorials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use-cases/ssh/#connect-to-ssh-server-with-cloudflared-access) on how to tunnel different protocols and applications. The process basically involves:

1. Setting up DNS records on your domain to point towards Cloudflare
2. Downloading & configuring the [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) client with your token
3. Assigning it a place on your domain (e.g. *ssh.example.org*) 
4. And if you want to add IAM (which I'd highly recommend), setting it up as an as an [Application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/)

Now I can use Home Assistant or SSH into my machine from anywhere with a pretty URL and login screen! 😇
