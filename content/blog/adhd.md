I was formally diagnosed with ADHD in November 2023, and it seems like a common sentiment but looking back it seems incredibly obvious. I've dumped some thoughts here I've had on it since then! 😇

## What it's like

I think for most of history ADHD was just termed *laziness*. Like, what do you mean you can be given a simple task and spend the next hour looking out the window? (or staring at your phone, or scrolling through random documents on your computer...)

Executive dysfunction is stigmatised, and it can be frustrating for others when not managed well. It's hard to blame people for expecting you to meet social conventions of perceived effort, but unfortunately, brains and people are complicated.

Basically, if the subject doesn't engage me at the time, it's difficult to initiate or process thoughts about how to do it. You just sort of sit there, head full of thoughts you don't want, that you can't stop, about things you don't want to care about.

...On the other hand, *ADHD brain* has an incredible capacity for intuiting things through guesswork and iteration. This didn't work well in school unfortunately, where teachers were stumped at how I managed to (almost) correctly calculate long division without a scribble of working. This part does have its upsides though.

## Strategies that work for me

Everyone's brain is different, I've had mixed success with different methods of learning/planning/paying attention but I'm sure they won't work for everyone. 

Putting some here so I remember them.

- **Don't get lost in structure/planning.** Productivity tools are fun. This is dangerous. whenever I find a new shiny *Habit Tracker*/Pomodoro App/Planning Tool (e.g. Notion), I'll inevitably spend hours deciding how I'm gonna use it, then never track a real task. Personally, I use the stock Reminders, Calendar, Email & Notes apps 🗓️

- **Start building things before you're ready.** As soon as you have the idea/interest, start building on top of the [quick-start tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), learn by doing, etc. 💪

- **Learn in varied formats.** If I'm reading a book I'm much more likely to finish it if I also have the audiobook version. It's nice listening while moving 🏃‍♂️

- **Take breaks.** Little & often innit 👍  Know when your brain is mush and accept that there's a daily cap of how much it can absorb.

- **Take notes.** In whatever format you're feeling at the time. My notes app is a flurry of voice notes, rambles (that I based this post on), images, etc. Sort as much as you prefer, but keyword search is good enough for me.

- **Try not to overstimulate yourself.** It's tempting to listen to music/podcasts/YouTube every waking minute, but it tricks my brain into feeling productive when I hear an interesting story or concept explained instead of doing what I planned to do 😭 ...Also quiet time is important for learning & forming memories so **STOP OVERCONSUMING!**

- **Be wary of addiction.** Vaping is expensive & TikTok fries your dopamine receptors. Good luck.

- **Turn on subtitles everywhere!** Watching TV/movies with subtitles on is apparently sacrilege? 🫣 It helps when I'm tired or when my tiny TV speakers struggle to decypher dialogue. You can turn on subtitles for any video/audio source in Chrome using *Live Captions*, as well as in MS Teams under *Captions and transcripts*. It also lets you scroll up through the last few sentences. It has saved me many times.

## Some autobio

In the weeks before my National 5s and Higher exams, my parents practically locked me at the kitchen table each evening to revise. I proceeded to spend most of that time browsing Twitter or Facebook on my laptop, or doodling on my jotter, as the anxiety piled up 🤡

**It shouldn't have been a surprise when I bombed it 💀**

Basically I had to resit Maths and English as well as a couple other subjects. I got a B and C after resitting them the following year. Small win! 💯

I'm familiar with the feeling now but I wasn't sure what it was at the time - the frustration and physical tension I felt trying to run through practice exam papers, stuck in revision jail, but at the time I heard everyone hates exams too. I was just cranky and/or lazy, I guess?

**Luckily, I had CompSci to fall back on 🤓**

Computing Science felt like my ticket, as up until then I never really had to exert myself or study - I spent a lot of time tinkering with related stuff and my level of existing knowledge helped me a lot. That plan fell apart by the 2nd year of university though.

 **tl;dr my code is bad**

I got more comfortable with learning through my time at university, but I suppose my interest in the course helped, as well as making friends I could chat about it with. Also having a viable career path 🕵🏻‍♂️

**Compulsory learning on a topic I'm not interested in and/or has no immediate use to me is still tragic scenes 🫡**

Does the ability to concentrate vary for most people week to week, assuming no external circumstance changes? I'll have a really productive week, run and exercise consistently, feel great about it, make a conscious effort to repeat that, then spend the following week depressed at how little I achieved.

Like everyone else, since my diagnosis I've been drowning in recommended content on *ADHD Life Hacks* and *Therapists Reacting to ADHD TikToks* as I've been looking to learn more about the disorder. A lot of them are relatable, but I'm not sure how much of it is actually related/a symptom.

[Dr. K's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN5BoBlY0MU) YouTube videos on ADHD have been useful - I've had more success with some of his strategies than most.

Currently investigating meds, will report back but the NHS waiting list is between 18-24 months. Check back then folks 👍
