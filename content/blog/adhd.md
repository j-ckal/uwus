I was formally diagnosed with ADHD in November 2023, and it seems like a common sentiment but looking back it seems incredibly obvious...

In the weeks before my National 5s and Higher exams, my parents practically locked me at the kichen table each evening to revise. I preceeded to spend most of that time browsing Twitter or Facebook on my laptop, or doodling on my jotter, as the anxiety piled up 🤡

**It shouldn't have been a surprise when I took a fat L 💀**

I can't remember exactly what my grade were, but I had to resit Maths and English as well as a couple other subjects. I guess I got a B and C after resitting them the following year. Small W 💯

I'm familar with the feeling now but I wasn't sure what it was at the time - the frustration and physical tension I felt running through practice papers stuck in revision jail, but at the time I heard everyone hates exams too. I was just lazy, I guess?

**Luckily, I had CompSci to fall back on 🤓**

Computing Science felt like my ticket, as up until then I never really had to exert myself or study - I spent a lot of time tinkering with related stuff and my level of existing knowledge helped me a lot. That plan fell apart by the 2nd year of university though.

 **tl;dr my code is bad**

I got more comfortable with learning through my time at university, but I suppose my interest in the course helped, as well as making friends I could chat about it with. Also having a viable career path 🕵🏻‍♂️

**Compulsory learning on a topic I'm not interested in and/or has no immediate use to me is still tragic scenes 🫡**

Does the ability to concentrate vary for most people week to week, assuming no external circumstance changes? I'll have a really productive week, run and exercise consistently, feel great about it, make a concious effort to repeat that, then spend the following week depressed at how little I achieved.

Like everyone else, since my diagnosis I've been drowning in recommended content on *ADHD Life Hacks* and *Therapists Reacting to ADHD TikToks* as I've been looking to learn more about the disorder. 

[HealthyGamerGG](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG)'s YouTube videos on ADHD have been useful - both to learn more and to see it through the *epic gamer nerd* lense. I've had more success with some of his strategies than most.

Currently investigating meds, will report back but the NHS waiting list is between 18-24 months. Check back then lads/shes/gays/theys 👍
