  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Hello! I&rsquo;ve not really figured out how to write in the style of a blog yet, so this probably comes across as somewhere between a Twitter thread and formal presentation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with secondary computers since I got a Pi 3B for my birthday in 2016, but didn&rsquo;t really use it for what I imagined a server to be, outside of installing Pi-hole to do DNS-level ad blocking. I wasn&rsquo;t that interested in the GPIO capabilities outside of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1y6sschMHc">university project</a>, and wanted something more powerful to play with.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-hp-prodesk">Enter, the HP ProDesk!</h2>
<p><img src="/images/homelab/hp.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I found this back in February, and aside from looking like it was pulled from a school computer lab, it checked all my boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power efficient - Reasonably modern T-sku CPU (Full support for <a href="https://metebalci.com/blog/a-minimum-complete-tutorial-of-cpu-power-management-c-states-and-p-states/">ACPI C-states</a>), uses &lt;5W while idle!</li>
<li>Hyperthreading for multithreaded workloads</li>
<li>8GB RAM + 256GB SSD included (No idea about the specs, but saved me money)</li>
<li>¬£70, which was cheaper than anything else I could find at the time</li>
</ul>
<p>The only issue was 1 broken USB port which I didn&rsquo;t mind, and a blemish I couldn&rsquo;t find.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m using an old USB <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HKVD2ZM/A/lacie-1tb-rugged-usb-c-portable-drive">LaCie drive</a> I had lying around for media storage, formatted in exFAT so I can still read/write from macOS &amp; Windows.</p>
<p>It arrived running Windows 10 with a registered project key (!) alas, I formatted it and installed Ubuntu Server 22.04, for no reason other than familiarity. I updated &amp; upgraded, copied over my SSH keys, and did the other boring stuff.</p>
<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
<p>I had Home Assistant and Plex <del>running</del> crawling on my Raspberry Pi, and this was my first experience managing multiple services running on bare metal on one machine.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, dealing with conflicting ports and dependencies was a headache - <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues/1785"><em>looking at you, Pi-hole</em></a> - and since I was starting from fresh I wanted to learn more about running Docker properly.  <em>~In Production~</em> I guess.</p>
<p>I migrated existing services over to the new containerised versions, which was surprisingly painless. I used docker-compose to deploy them, with much help from the <a href="https://linuxserver.io">linuxserver.io images &amp; docs</a>.</p>
<p>I later learnt about <a href="https://portainer.io">Portainer</a> which I now use to reduce the amount of time spent finding container logs &amp; managing things from the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="external-access">External Access</h2>
<p>For a while I exposed the <em>raw, unadulterated ports</em> of my self-hosted services to the internet, and watched fail2ban go to work on the deluge of bot attacks, predominately originating from China and DigitalOcean. This made me uneasy, and I wanted to add another layer of security to my home-lab.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homelab/fail2banlogs.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a Cloudflare Tunnel to expose Home Assistant &amp; SSH to the internet, protected behind SSO. It&rsquo;s crazy how many of Cloudflare&rsquo;s services are available on the free tier! This method mitigates some risks but introduces some new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer exposing any ports from my home network, preventing bots from bruteforcing/exploiting possible future vulnerabilities üëç</li>
<li>An approved login method, verified through CloudFlare, is now required before any services can be reached üëç</li>
<li>Since Cloudflare is proxying traffic going to/from my server, they now have the ability to inspect/analyse this üëé</li>
<li>I now have a permanently running, self-updating binary running that has access to my system &amp; local network (I could improve this with segmentation, but for now üëé)</li>
</ul>
<p>I followed a few different <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use-cases/ssh/#connect-to-ssh-server-with-cloudflared-access">tutorials</a> on how to tunnel different protocols and applications. The process basically involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up DNS records on your domain to point towards Cloudflare</li>
<li>Downloading &amp; configuring the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared">cloudflared</a> client with your token</li>
<li>Assigning it a place on your domain (e.g. <em>ssh.example.org</em>)</li>
<li>And if you want to add IAM (which I&rsquo;d highly recommend), setting it up as an as an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/">Application</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Now I can use Home Assistant or SSH into my machine from anywhere with a pretty URL and login screen! üòá</p>
